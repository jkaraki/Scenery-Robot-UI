<h1 id="client-gui-for-robot-remote-control">Client GUI for Robot Remote Control</h1>
<p>This is the client side code for manual control of the robot. To run this code, you only need Node.js and npm. To install these dependencies, please refer to <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm">https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm</a>. </p>
<h3 id="important-aspects">Important aspects.</h3>
<ul>
<li>This entire &quot;client&quot; folder <strong>needs</strong> to be copied into the &quot;middleman&quot; folder in this repo. </li>
<li>This code will work with any controller with a usb dongle (no drivers needed) but we recommend using an Xbox 360 controller for best results.</li>
<li>This code works best on OS X and Linux systems but will function on Windows.</li>
</ul>

<p>This project was bootstrapped with <a href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app">Create React App</a>.</p>
<h3 id="available-scripts">Available Scripts</h3>
<p>In the project directory (for me it was /Users/josephkaraki/middleman/client), you can run:</p>
<h4 id="npm-start"><code>npm start</code></h4>
<p>Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open <a href="http://localhost:3000">http://localhost:3000</a> to view it in the browser.</p>
<p>The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.</p>
<h4 id="npm-test"><code>npm test</code></h4>
<p>Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about <a href="https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests">running tests</a> for more information.</p>
<h4 id="npm-run-build"><code>npm run build</code></h4>
<p>Builds the app for production to the <code>build</code> folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.</p>
<p>The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!</p>
<p>See the section about <a href="https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment">deployment</a> for more information.</p>
<h4 id="npm-run-eject"><code>npm run eject</code></h4>
<p><strong>Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you <code>eject</code>, you can’t go back!</strong></p>
<p>If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can <code>eject</code> at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.</p>
<p>Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except <code>eject</code> will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.</p>
<p>You don’t have to ever use <code>eject</code>. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.</p>
